# Local-Blockchain-Using-Python
In this repo I have made a local blockchain to get the understanding of how a blockchain works also I h've applied Consensus Protocol and Performed an Initial Coin Offering too.

- Blockchain.py is the main blockchain file.
- etherwallet is a type of wallet and project to understand the work of how wallets store, transfer and how transactions are done.
- ishcoin.py is the ICO file
- ishcoin_node_500*.py files are the nodes or users which will connect to our blockchain on port 5000 in order to get the consesus protocol thing work.
- nodes.json is to store all the nodes connected to our blockchain.
- transaction.json is to view and store all the transactions occured in our ICO.
